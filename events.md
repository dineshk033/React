# Understanding Synthetic Events in React

React abstracts browser events into its own event system called **Synthetic Events**. This provides a consistent and reliable way to handle events across all browsers.

---

## Why Does React Use Synthetic Events?

1. **Cross-browser Consistency:**  
   Browsers can implement events differently. React's synthetic events normalize these differences so your code works the same everywhere.

2. **Performance Optimization:**  
   Synthetic events are pooled. Instead of creating a new event object for every event, React reuses event objects, reducing memory usage and increasing performance.

3. **Unified API:**  
   Synthetic events provide a single set of properties and methods (like `event.preventDefault()` and `event.stopPropagation()`) that behave identically in all browsers.

## Synthetic Events vs. Native DOM Events

| Aspect                | Synthetic Event (React)                                    | Native DOM Event                     |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Consistency           | Uniform API, cross-browser                                 | May vary between browsers            |
| Event Object          | Pooled and reused for performance                          | New object for each event            |
| Usage                 | Used in React event handlers (`onClick`, `onChange`, etc.) | Used in raw DOM event listeners      |
| Lifecycle             | Event object is reused; cannot be accessed asynchronously  | Can be accessed asynchronously       |
| Access to Native      | Available via `event.nativeEvent`                          | Native by default                    |

### How Event Handling Works in React

- **Event handlers** are functions you define and pass to elements as props (e.g., `onClick={myHandler}`).
- React wraps browser events in its own synthetic event system for consistency and performance.
- You should define event handlers inside your component, and you can use state to update the UI in response to events.

### Example: Handling a Button Click

Let’s make a counter that increments every time you click a Bootstrap button.

```jsx
// src/App.js

import React, { useState } from 'react';

function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  function handleClick() {
    setCount(count + 1);
  }

  return (
    <div className="container mt-5">
      <h2>Counter Example</h2>
      <p>Button clicked <span className="badge bg-primary">{count}</span> times</p>
      <button className="btn btn-success" onClick={handleClick}>
        Increment Counter
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

#### What’s happening here?

- `useState(0)` creates a `count` state variable, initialized to 0.
- `handleClick` is an event handler that increments `count`.
- The button’s `onClick` prop is set to `handleClick`, so it runs every time the button is clicked.

### Common Event Props in React

| Event                   | Prop Name    | Example Usage                   |
|-------------------------|-------------|---------------------------------|
| Click                   | onClick     | `<button onClick={fn}>`         |
| Change (input, select)  | onChange    | `<input onChange={fn} />`       |
| Form submit             | onSubmit    | `<form onSubmit={fn}>`          |
| Mouse enter/leave       | onMouseEnter| `<div onMouseEnter={fn}>`       |
| Key press               | onKeyDown   | `<input onKeyDown={fn} />`      |

### Quick Checklist for Events in React

- [x] Use camelCase for event props (e.g., `onClick`, not `onclick`)
- [x] Pass a function as the event handler, not a string
- [x] Use state (`useState`) to update your UI in response to events
- [x] Use event objects for more details (e.g., `event.target.value` for input changes)
- [x] Prevent default behavior (like form submit reload) using `event.preventDefault()`

## The Need for `event.persist()`

Because React reuses synthetic event objects for performance (event pooling), the event object’s properties will be cleared and recycled after your handler finishes.  
If you need to access the event object asynchronously (for example, inside a `setTimeout` or after an async call), you **must call `event.persist()`** to remove it from the pool and keep its data.

### Example: Accessing Event Asynchronously

**Without `event.persist()` (Incorrect):**
```jsx
function MyComponent() {
  function handleClick(event) {
    setTimeout(() => {
      // ❌ This won't work as expected! event is already released.
      alert(event.type); // Might alert 'undefined' or throw error
    }, 1000);
  }
  return <button onClick={handleClick}>Click Me</button>;
}
```

**With `event.persist()` (Correct):**
```jsx
function MyComponent() {
  function handleClick(event) {
    event.persist(); // Prevents event object from being reused
    setTimeout(() => {
      // ✅ This now works as expected
      alert(event.type); // Will alert 'click'
    }, 1000);
  }
  return <button onClick={handleClick}>Click Me</button>;
}
```

## Checklist: Handling Events in React

- [x] Use camelCase event props (e.g., `onClick`, `onChange`)
- [x] Use function references, not strings, for handlers
- [x] Use state (`useState`) to update UI in response to events
- [x] Use `event.persist()` if you need the event after your handler completes
- [x] Access the native browser event via `event.nativeEvent` if needed

---

## Summary

- Synthetic events give you a consistent, efficient way to handle user interaction in React.
- They differ from native DOM events by normalizing APIs and pooling event objects for performance.
- Use `event.persist()` if you need to use the event object asynchronously.
